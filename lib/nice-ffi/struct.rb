# A class to be used as a baseclass where you would use FFI::Struct.
# It acts mostly like FFI::Struct, but with nice extra features and
# conveniences to make life easier:
#
# * Automatically defines read and write accessor methods (e.g. #x,
#   #x=) for struct members when you call #layout. (You can use
#   #hidden and #read_only before or after calling #layout to affect
#   which members have accessors.)
#
# * Implements "smart" accessors for TypedPointer types, seamlessly
#   wrapping those members so you don't even have to think about the
#   fact they are pointers!
#
# * Implements a nicer #new method which allows you to create a new
#   struct and set its data in one shot by passing an Array, Hash, or
#   another instance of the class (to copy data). You can also use it
#   to wrap a FFI::Pointer like FFI::Struct can.
#
# * Implements #to_ary and #to_hash to dump the struct data.
#
# * Implements #to_s and #inspect for nice debugging output.
#
# * Adds ::typed_pointer convenience alias to create a TypedPointer
#   for this klass.
#
# * Provides automatic memory management for Pointers if you define
#   MyClass.release( pointer). (This can be disabled per-instance by
#   providing {:autorelease => false} as an option to #new).
#
class NiceFFI::Struct < FFI::Struct
  include NiceFFI::AutoRelease

  class << self

    # Returns a NiceFFI::TypedPointer instance for this class.
    # Equivalent to NiceFFI::TypedPointer.new( this_class, options )
    #
    def typed_pointer( options={} )
      NiceFFI::TypedPointer.new(self, options)
    end


    # Same syntax as FFI::Struct#layout, but also defines nice
    # accessors for the attributes.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #   class Rect < NiceStruct
    #     layout( :x, :int16,
    #             :y, :int16,
    #             :w, :uint16,
    #             :h, :uint16 )
    #   end
    #
    def layout( *spec )
      @nice_spec = spec

      # Wrap the members.
      0.step(spec.size - 1, 2) { |index|
        member, type = spec[index, 2]
        wrap_member( member, type)
      }

        case a
        when NiceFFI::TypedPointer
          :pointer
        else
          a
        end
      }

      super( *simple_spec )
    end


    # Mark the given members as hidden, i.e. do not create accessors
    # for them in #layout, and do not print them out in #to_s, etc.
    # You can call this before or after calling #layout, and can call
    # it more than once if you like.
    #
    # Note: They can still be read and written via #[] and #[]=,
    # but will not have convenience accessors.
    #
    # Note: This will remove the accessor methods (if they exist) for
    # the members! So if you're defining your own custom accessors, do
    # that *after* you have called this method.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #   class SecretStruct < NiceStruct
    #
    #     # You can use it before the layout...
    #     hidden( :hidden1 )

    #             :visible2, :int,

    #             :hidden2,  :pointer )
    #
    #     # ... and/or after it.
    #     hidden( :hidden2 )
    #
    #     # :hidden1 and :hidden2 are now both hidden.
